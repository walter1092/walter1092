# Hi there! 👋 I'm Walter
Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, with a focus on robotics and automation. My passion lies in crafting innovative solutions to real-world problems, whether through designing mechanical systems or developing code.

## 🚀 About Me
🌏 Global Explorer: Currently, I'm in Germany for an internship, diving deep into ROS2 development and simulation projects. I'm inspired by how technology and individualism come together to shape a better future.
🤖 Robotics Enthusiast: I aim to work on humanoid robots that can assist humanity.
🎮 Game Design Aspirant: Besides engineering, I'm exploring video game development. I have a keen interest in blending creativity with technical expertise to design immersive gaming experiences.
🗨️ Storyteller: I believe every individual is the hero of their own story, and I aim to capture and share those narratives through my work and interactions.
## 💡 Key Skills
Programming Languages: Python, C++, Java (intermediate), and Turtle library for creative coding.
Tools & Frameworks: ROS2, Gazebo, URDF, and simulation technologies.
Areas of Expertise: Robotics, mechanical design, and ideation with a focus on practicality and efficiency.
## 🌱 Currently Learning
Advanced ROS2 functionalities for better robotics simulations and control.
Basics of game design coding to eventually merge my engineering skills with creative pursuits.
Exploring German culture and traditions, balancing the need for progress with preserving stability.
## 🌟 Fun Facts
I love playing video games (feel free to recommend some!).
I enjoy deep discussions about philosophy, history, and politics, especially when they challenge conventional views.
I advocate for a nuanced perspective on Singapore and its systems, even if it means acknowledging its flaws while striving for constructive solutions.
